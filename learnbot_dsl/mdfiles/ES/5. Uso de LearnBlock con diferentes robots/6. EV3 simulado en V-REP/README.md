# Simulated EV3 under V-REP

Using the simulated version of EV3 firstly requires for the installation of the V-REP simulator. You can get different versions of V-REP from [http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) (recommended version: 3.6.2). Once you have installed V-REP, you will need to download the scene file including the EV3 robot (ev3.ttt). Such file can be downloaded using the following command: 

	wget https://github.com/robocomp/LearnBlock/tree/version-3/LB_add_files/ev3.ttt

Start V-REP and open ev3.ttt. Once you start the simulation, you can run programs created with LearnBlock on the simulated EV3 (ver la secci√≥n [Ejecutar un programa desde LearnBlock](<hidepath>/ES/4. Ejecutar un programa desde LearnBlock/README.html)).
