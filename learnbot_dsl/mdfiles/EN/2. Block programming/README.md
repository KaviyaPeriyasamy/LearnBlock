To create a program using blocks, you have to select the blocks from the lists of the left. Lists of blocks are organized in different categories according to the functionality of the block. To select a block from a certain category, just click on the corresponding tag.

Once a block has been clicked, it appears on the program editor (central pane). Then, the block can be move to connect it to other block. A right click on the block shows a contextual menu though which the block can be edited, duplicated or deleted.

The edit option of the contextual menu is used to specify values of the parameters of the block (if any). If the program includes variables, a name of a variable can be selected in the field labelled as "Set to".
